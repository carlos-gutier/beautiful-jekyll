This [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Blood+Transfusion+Service+Center) is from a mobile blood donation vehicle in Taiwan. The Blood Transfusion Service Center drives to different universities and collects blood as part of a blood drive.

Our goal is to predict the last column, whether the donor made a donation in March 2007, using information about each donor's history. We'll measure success using recall score as the model evaluation metric.

**Good data-driven systems for tracking and predicting donations and supply needs can improve the entire supply chain**, making sure that more patients get the blood transfusions they need.
