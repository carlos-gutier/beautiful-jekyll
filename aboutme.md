- Finance Undergrad
- Former non-profit manager
- Interested in using Deep Learning and Computer Visualization to track that which is commonly overlooked by the human eye

Hi, I'm Carlos Gutierrez, a data scientist focused on helping firms improve business logistics by applying machine learing and AI solutions. To do this, I specialize in computer vision applications, natural language processing, and deploying machine learning models with user interfaces.

### Recommenders
I've learned techniques for the "cold start" problem - making recommendiations for new users without much information. Offline, salespeople build rapport, but online, how can you learn quickly? To explore this, I developed a ___ that learns your ___ in just 10 questions. I gained experience with___, using Python's scikit-learn and Suprise libraries.

### Natural Language Processing
I'm experienced in scraping, processing, and analyzing ustructured text data with Python, including___

### Deploying models
I prototype in Jupyter Notebook, with Pandas to wrangle, Matplotlib to visualize, and Scikit-learn to model. Then I deploy interactive web apps to make models useful. I use Ploty Dash, Dash, a framework built on React, D3, and Flask.

Managing an Non-Profit organization tought me to market and study target customers. I'd love to work with you to solve business problems using machine learning and AI.
