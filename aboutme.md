Hi, I'm Carlos Gutierrez, a Data Analyst focused on using Statistics, Python, SQL and Machine Learning algorithims to get insights and find solutions through data. My recent projects include a wide range of topics including:

* **App to easily detect and identify prescription pills** — using images using user images and SQL databases.
* **Supply-chain predictions** — predicting blood donations for a blood center based on previous donors to improve on supply chain.
* **Finding and comparing trends in data** — historical temperature trends in the city of Houston versus global trends.
* **Using simple statistics to remain competitive at lower cost** — recommendation system for trading *overvalued* players for *undervalued* in soccer teams.
* And others on the works...
